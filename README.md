# NBA Predict Best Lineup Combinations
This project is based on the article published in the MIT SLOAN Sports Conference in 2020 named: NBA	Lineup	Analysis	on	Clustered	Player	Tendencies: A	new	approach	to	the	positions	of	basketball	&
modeling	lineup	efficiency	of	soft	lineup	aggregates. The approach is making a prediction of the best possible combinations for a NBA 5-man lineup based on a previous probabilistic clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models.
